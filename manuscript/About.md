# The Monad Manifesto - Annotated

by Jeffrey Snover
as annotated by the PowerShell Community

---

This project is intended to preserve and annotate "[The Monad Manifesto](http://www.jsnover.com/blog/2011/10/01/monad-manifesto/)," a paper written by Windows PowerShell inventor[Jeffrey Snover](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Jeffrey%20Snover%20Windows%20Server) at Microsoft in [2002](http://takemeback.to/08-August-2002#.VWsXW1xVhBc). The idea for this project came from Pluralsight author [Tim Warner](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/tim-warner), with the initial annotations being made by Tim and Microsoft MVP [Don Jones](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon).

The original Manifesto was a forward-looking document, predating the public release of PowerShell by around 4 years. In the years since PowerShell's [2006 release](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2006/11/14/windows-powershell-1-0-released.aspx), the product has evolved substantially - but always around the broad brush strokes outlined in the Manifesto.

We felt that it was not only important to preserve the document for historical purposes, but also to annotate and expand upon the various concepts it introduces. We'll attempt to link to references for the now-real technologies that the Manifest predicted, and to provide contextual explanations around some of the Manifesto's directives.

You'll notice [^1] footnotes in the text. These are a [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) feature that aren't supported by our publishing platform, but they're meant to link to corresponding footnotes at the bottom of the page. In some cases, these are Jeffrey's original footnotes, and we've marked those with "ORIGINAL" to set them apart from footnotes we've added ourselves.
